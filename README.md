# METALLIC-SCRAP-COLLECTOR-BOT
Problem statement: -The workshop floor in the foundries faces a unique problem of collecting the metal scrap fallen on the ground and it needs to be cleaned by the laborers working in the environment. The laborers find it tedious to collect and separate the metal scrap from the dust. Thus there is a need of a machine to collect the iron filings on the ground floor in the foundry.

Objectives:-
• To collect the metallic scrap
• To separate the ferrous and non ferrous metal scrap

Outcome:- Automated And Portable device to collect and Segregate the metal scrap Technology & Innovation.

Technology:

 1) Internet of Things (IoT)
 2) Sensor Network
 3) Embedded Systems (Arduino MEGA 2560)
 4) Automation and Robotic

Innovation: The model comprises an iron collecting unit either using an iron sucking section or using magnetism to attract the iron filings from the ground and release the iron filings into the iron collecting unit. The model demonstrates the separation of ferrous and non-ferrous material in an efficient manner.

Social impact:

 1) To help the people working on the shop floor with an automated machine that can assist them in an easy way.
2) The scrap can be reused in the foundry after separation. With an objective of assisting the shop floor working professionals the model is designed.

Components used :
1 . Arduino Mega-2560(1)

2. DC Motors-60rpm(5)

3. Bluetooth HC-05(1)
4.  Ball Magnets(5)
